It was first described in the medical literature in 1987 by Ritscher and Schinzel, for whom the disorder is sometimes named.\\n\\n==Signs and symptoms==\\nThe classical triad of symptoms that defines 3C syndrome includes certain heart defects, [[hypoplasia]] (underdevelopment) of the [[cerebellum]], and cranial dysmorphisms, which can take various forms. The heart defects and cranial dysmorphisms are heterogeneous in individuals who are all classed as having Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome.<ref name=\"Orpha\"/>\\n\\nHeart defects commonly seen with Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome are associated with the [[endocardial cushion]] and are the most important factor in determining a diagnosis. The [[mitral valve]] and [[tricuspid valve]] of the heart can be malformed, the [[atrioventricular canal]] can be complete instead of developing into the [[interatrial septum]] and [[interventricular septum]], and [[conotruncal heart defect]]s, which include [[tetralogy of Fallot]], [[double outlet right ventricle]], [[transposition of the great vessels]],<ref name=\"Orpha\"/> and [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]]. [[Aortic stenosis]] and [[pulmonary stenosis]] have also been associated with 3C syndrome.<ref name=OMIM-C/>\\n\\nThe cranial dysmorphisms associated with 3C syndrome are heterogeneous and include a degree of [[macrocephaly]], a large [[anterior fontanel]], a particularly prominent [[occiput]] and forehead, ocular [[hypertelorism]] (wide-set eyes), slanted [[palpebral fissure]]s, [[cleft palate]], a depressed nasal bridge, [[cleft palate]] with associated [[palatine uvula#Variation|bifid uvula]],<ref name=\"Orpha\"/> low-set ears, [[micrognathia]] (an abnormally small jaw),<ref name=OMIM/> [[brachycephaly]] (flattened head), and ocular [[coloboma]].<ref name=OMIM-C>{{cite web |url = http://omim.org/clinicalSynopsis/220210 |title = Ritscher-Schinzel Syndrome - Clinical Synopsis |work = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |publisher = Johns Hopkins University |last1 = Kniffin |first1 = Cassandra L. |last2 = Jackson |first2 = John F. |date = 6 January 2014 |accessdate = 12 April 2014}}</ref> Low-set ears are the most common cranial dysmorphism seen in 3C syndrome, and ocular coloboma is the least common of the non-concurrent symptoms (cleft lip co-occurring with cleft palate is the least common).<ref name=Leonardi/>\\n\\nCranial dysplasias associated with 3C syndrome are also reflected in the brain. Besides the cerebellar hypoplasia, cysts are commonly found in the [[posterior cranial fossa]], the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and the [[cisterna magna]] are dilated/enlarged, and [[Dandy-Walker malformation]] is present. These are reflected in the developmental delays typical of the disease.<ref name=OMIM/><ref name=Leonardi/> 75% of children with 3C syndrome have Dandy-Walker malformation and [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name=Gorlin>{{cite book |title = Syndromes of the Head and Neck |first1 = Robert J. |last1 = Gorlin |first2 = Michael |last2 = Cohen Jr. |first3 = Raoul C.M. |last3 = Hennekam |edition = 4 |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2001 |isbn = 9780199747726}}</ref>\\n\\nSigns and symptoms in other body systems are also associated with 3C syndrome. In the [[skeletal system]], ribs may be absent, and [[hemivertebrae]], [[syndactyly]] (fusion of fingers together), and [[clinodactyly]] (curvature of the fifth finger) may be present.<ref name=OMIM-C/><ref name=Gorlin/> In the GI and genitourinary systems, [[anal atresia]], [[hypospadia]] (misplaced [[urethra]]), and [[hydronephrosis]] may exist. [[Adrenal hypoplasia]] and [[growth hormone deficiency]] are associated [[endocrine]] consequences of Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome.<ref name=OMIM-C/> Some [[immunodeficiency]] has also been reported in connection with 3C syndrome.<ref name=Gorlin/>\\n\\nMany children with the disorder die as infants due to severe congenital heart disease.<ref name=OMIM/> The [[proband]] of Ritscher and Schinzel\\'s original study was still alive at the age of 21.<ref name=Jones>{{cite book |title = Smith\\'s Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation |first1 = Kenneth Lyons |last1 = Jones |first2 = Marilyn Crandall |last2 = Jones |first3 = Miguel |last3 = del Campo |edition = 7th |publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences |year = 2013 |isbn = 9780323186681}}</ref>\\n\\nA [[fetus]] with 3C syndrome may have an [[umbilical cord]] with one [[umbilical artery]] instead of two.<ref name=OMIM-C/><ref name=Jones/>\\n\\n==Differential diagnosis==\\nThere is an overlap in symptoms between 3C syndrome and [[Joubert syndrome]]. Joubert syndrome often manifests with similar cerebellar hypoplasia and its sequelae, including [[hyperpnea]], [[ataxia]], changes in eye movement, and cleft lip and palate. Occasionally, Joubert syndrome will include heart malformations. [[Brachmann-de Lange syndrome]] must also be differentiated from 3C syndrome. It presents with similar craniofacial and heart abnormalities and can include Dandy-Walker phenotype, making it difficult to distinguish. Dandy-Walker malformation is also occasionally seen in [[Ellis-van Creveld syndrome]], which is characterized by heart defects and malformed [[alveolar ridge]].<ref name=Leonardi/> Many disorders include the Dandy-Walker phenotype and thus it is not [[pathognomonic]] for 3C syndrome.<ref name=Albright>{{cite book |title = Principles and Practice of Pediatric Neurosurgery |publisher = Thieme |year = 2011 |first1 = A. Leland |last1 = Albright |first2 = Ian F. |last2 = Pollack |isbn = 9781604064605}}</ref> \\n\\n[[CHARGE syndrome]] can also be misdiagnosed. This is because both CHARGE syndrome and 3C syndrome share symptoms of ocular colobomas, cardiac defects, growth retardation, and minor facial abnormalities.<ref name=\"Orpha\" />\\n\\n[[Coffin-Siris syndrome]] presents with fifth-finger deformities and congenital heart defects. It is distinguished from 3C syndrome by differences in facial dysmorphisms.<ref name=Gorlin/>\\n\\n==Prognosis==\\nPrognoses for 3C syndrome vary widely based on the specific constellation of symptoms seen in an individual. Typically, the gravity of the prognosis correlates with the severity of the cardiac abnormalities. For children with less severe cardiac abnormalities, the developmental prognosis depends on the cerebellar abnormalities that are present. Severe cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with growth and speech delays, as well as hypotonia and general growth deficiencies.<ref name=Leonardi/>\\n\\n==Genetics==\\n\\n[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|3C syndrome has an [[Recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance. This means that two parents with one copy of the gene each will not have the disease themselves, but can pass on the gene to their children.

Strumpellin is highly [[gene expression|expressed]] in [[skeletal muscle]] cells and mutations in it are also associated with [[spastic paraplegia]].

In smaller communities, the [[founder effect]] can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community.  Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else.  Other diseases, such as many rare forms of [[cancer]], have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare.

It has been found to be caused by mutation in the [[endothelin B receptor gene]] (EDNRB).\\n\\n==Classification==\\n\\nABCD syndrome is defined as albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut, and [[deafness]].  It was initially misdiagnosed and later discovered that a [[homozygous]] [[mutation]] in the EDNRB gene causes ABCD syndrome. This helped scientists discover that it is the same as type IV Waardenburg syndrome, also known as Shah-[[Waardenburg Syndrome]].\\n\\n==Characteristics==\\n\\nIn the beginning, medical officials defined ABCD syndrome by the four key characteristics of the syndrome.  In the first case study of the Kurdish girl, researches described her as having \\u201calbinism and a black lock at the right temporo-occiptital region along [[Blaschko]] lines, her eyelashes and brows were white, the irises in her eyes appeared to be blue, she had spots of retinal [[depigmentation]], and she did not react to noise.\\u201d<ref name=\"gross\" />  The albinism is interesting in this diagnosis because the skin of an affected individual is albino pale besides the brown patches of mispigmented skin.  The \\u201cblack locks\\u201d described and seen in clinical pictures of the infants are thick patches of black hair above the ears that form a half circle reaching to the other ear to make a crest shape.\\n\\nAs identified in this first case study and stated in a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, ABCD syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201csnow white hair in patches, distinct black locks of hair, skin white except brown macules, deafness, irises gray to blue, nystagmus, [[photophobia]], poor visual activity, normal [[melanocytes]] in pigmented hair and skin, and absent melanocytes in areas of leukoderma.\\u201d<ref name=\"mallory\">{{cite encyclopedia| author = Mallory, Susan B.| title = ABCD Syndrome | encyclopedia = An Illustrated Dictionary of Dermatologic Syndromes | edition = 2  | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]]| year = 2006 }}</ref> Individuals have the blue/gray irises typical of people affected by blindness. The C of ABCD syndrome is what distinguishes this genetic disorder from BADS and it involves cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut.  This characteristic occurs when nerve cells do not function correctly in the gut, which results in aganglionosis: The intestines\\u2019 failure to move food along the digestive tract.  Deafness or being unresponsive to noise due to very low quality of hearing was reported in every case of ABCD syndrome.  The characteristics of ABCD syndrome are clearly evident in an inflicted individual.\\n\\nNo longer considered a separate syndrome, ABCD syndrome is today considered to be a variation of Shah-Waardenburg type IV. [[Waardenburg syndrome]] (WS) is described as \\u201cthe combination of sensorinerual hearing loss, hypopigmentation of skin and hair, and pigmentary disturbances of the irides.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\" /> Hearing loss and deafness, skin mispigmentation and albinism, and pigmentary changes in irises are the similarities between WS and ABCD. According to a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201cdepigmentaion of hair and skin - white forelock and prematuring graying of hair, confluent thick eyebrows, heterochromic irides or hypopigmentation of iris, laterally displacy inner canthi, congenital sensorinerual deafness, broad nasal root, autosomal dominant disorder, and other associated findings, including black forelocks.\\u201d<ref name=\"mallory\" />\\n\\n==Causes and DNA testing==\\n\\nResearchers in the past 20 years have determined that a gene mutation, specifically a [[homozygous]] mutation in the EDNRB gene, is the cause of ABCD syndrome. The advancement of technology led to new [[DNA]] material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely.  A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes.  The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called denaturing gradient [[gel electrophoresis]]. The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine align on the double strands of DNA. The test results found \\u201can aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene. The mutation was determined to be a homozygous C to T base pair transition at the amino acid level, causing a premature stop in gene translation.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\" /> This specialized testing enables geneticists to recognize the gene mutation that is the cause of ABCD syndrome.\\n\\nNew findings introduced an important break in the beliefs about ABCD syndrome because the endotherlin B gene is a gene involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.

Discovering that the same gene is involved in ABCD and Waardenburg syndrome is important because researchers can now look further into ways to fix this crucial gene.\\n\\n==Screening==\\n\\nScreening generally only takes place among those displaying several of the symptoms of ABCD, but a study on a large group of institutionalized deaf people in Columbia revealed that 5.38% of them were Waardenburg patients. Because of its rarity, none of the patients were diagnosed with ABCD (Waardenburg Type IV). Nothing can be done to prevent the disease.\\n\\n==Diagnosis==\\n\\nThe occurrence of WS has been reported to be one in 45,000 in Europe.

For example, one suffering from hearing loss would be given hearing aids, and those with Hirschsprung\\u2019s disorder can be treated with a colostomy.\\n\\n==Prognosis==\\n\\nIf the [[Hirschsprung\\'s disease]] is treated in time, ABCD sufferers live otherwise healthy lives.  If it is not found soon enough, death often occurs in infancy. For those suffering hearing loss, it is generally regressive and the damage to hearing increases over time. Digestive problems from the colostomy and reattachment may exist, but most cases can be treated with laxatives. The only other debilitating symptom is hearing loss, which is usually degenerative and can only be treated with surgery or hearing aids.\\n\\n==History==\\n\\nDutch ophthalmologist [[Petrus Johannes Waardenburg]] (1886\\u20131979) brought about the idea of Waardenburg syndrome when he examined two deaf twins.<ref name=\"p.j.waardenburg\">{{cite journal |first=P.

This helped them distinguish forms of Waardenburg syndrome.  Their evaluation consisted of specifying Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1), type II (WS2), type III (WS3), and type IV (WS4).\\n\\nIn 1995, a case study was performed of a Kurdish family.  Scientists completed a molecular analysis with DNA strands of the patients diagnosed with ABCD syndrome.  Their task was to scan the sequences to find a mutation in the EDNRB gene, one of the most important protein-coding genes.  When they completed the scan they \\u201cfound a homozygous C to T transition resulting, at the amino acid level, in a premature stop codon.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\">{{Cite journal |author= Verheij, Joke B.G.M., Jurgen Kunze, Jan Osinga, Anthonie J. van Essen, and Robert M.

This condition occurs only in females, as there are no Y chromosomes present. Tetrasomy X was first described in 1961, and since then approximately 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Approximately 60 females have been described in medical literature with this condition.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}\\n\\n==Causes and diagnosis==\\n[[File:XXXX syndrome.svg|thumb|right]]Tetrasomy X is a [[aneuploidy|chromosomal aneuploidy]], meaning it arises from a defect in [[meiosis]]. This can occur when homologous X chromosomes fail to separate in the formation of the egg or sperm. Tetrasomy X is usually suspected based on symptoms present in the individual and is confirmed via [[karyotype|karyotyping]], which reveals the extra X chromosomes.\\n\\n==Symptoms==\\nSymptoms of tetrasomy X are highly variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Symptoms are often similar to those of [[trisomy X]].<ref name=Tartaglia>{{cite journal |title = A review of trisomy X (47, XXX) |first1 = Nicole R. |last = Tartaglia |first2 = Susan |last2 = Howell |first3 = Ashley |last3 = Sutherland |first4 = Rebecca |last4 = Wilson |first5 = Lennie |last5 = Wilson |journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |date = 11 May 2010 |volume = 5 |issue = 8 |doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-5-8 |PMC=2883963 |pmid=20459843}}</ref> Physically, tetrasomy X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as [[epicanthal fold]]s, flat nasal bridges, upslanting [[palpebral fissure]]s, midface [[hypoplasia]], small mouths, [[cleft palate|cleft or high arched palates]], delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including [[hypotonia]] and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study conducted by [http://www.genealogysource.com/tetra_x/ Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support] found that 10% of girls had joint laxity in the hips and 20% had joint limitations in a sample size of 20 tetrasomy and pentasomy patients.\\n\\nDevelopmentally, tetrasomy X patients frequently show mild delays in the areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo [[puberty]] normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical literature reports four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with [[trisomy 21]], one stillborn with [[omphalocele]].\\n\\nIn terms of internal organ systems, tetrasomy X patients may have abnormal vision, hearing, circulatory systems, kidneys, or nervous systems. Disorders of the eye include [[myopia]], [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[coloboma]], microphthalmus, or [[optic nerve hypoplasia]]. In terms of hearing, patients are more prone to [[ear infection]]s, sound blockage, or nerve abnormalities. Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including [[septal defect|ventricular/atrial septal defects]], [[atresia]], [[hypoplastic right heart syndrome]], [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and conotruncal or valvular cardiac defects. Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an [[EEG]] or [[MRI]].\\n\\n==Treatment and prognosis==\\nThe general prognosis for girls with tetrasomy X is relatively good. Due to the variability of symptoms, some tetrasomy X girls are able to function normally, whereas others will need medical attention throughout their lives. Traditionally, treatment for tetrasomy X has been management of the symptoms and support for learning. Most girls are placed on estrogen treatment to induce breast development, arrest longitudinal growth, and stimulate bone formation to prevent osteoporosis. Speech, occupational, and physical therapy may also be needed depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n\\n== In other species ==\\nWith the [[Echidna]] this kind of chromosomal arrangement is normal.

The sons of female carriers are at 50% risk of being affected with the syndrome. The daughters of female carriers are at 50% risk of being carriers themselves. Females may have mild manifestations of the syndrome. The syndrome is caused by [[mutation]] in a [[gene]] called [[FGDY1]] in band p11.21 on the [[X chromosome]].\\n\\n==Pathophysiology==\\nThe Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is due to mutation in the [[FGD1]] gene. FGD1 encodes a [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] (GEF) that specifically activates [[Cdc42]], a member of the [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] (Ras homology) family of the p21 [[GTPase]]s. By activating Cdc42, FGD1 [[protein]] stimulates [[fibroblast]]s to form filopodia, cytoskeletal elements involved in cellular signaling, adhesion, and migration. Through Cdc42, FGD1 protein also activates the [[c-Jun N-terminal kinase]] (JNK) signaling cascade, a pathway that regulates cell growth, [[apoptosis]], and cellular differentiation.\\n\\nWithin the developing mouse skeleton, FGD1 protein is expressed in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations, the [[perichondrium]] and periosteum, proliferating [[chondrocyte]]s, and [[osteoblast]]s. These results suggest that FGD1 signaling may play a role in the biology of several different skeletal cell types including mesenchymal prechondrocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome.\\n\\nIt appears likely that the primary defect in Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is an abnormality of FGD1/Cdc42 signaling resulting in anomalous [[embryonic development]] and abnormal endochondral and intramembranous bone formation.\\n\\n==Diagnosis==\\n[[Genetic testing]] may be available for mutations in the FGDY1 gene.  [[Genetic counseling]] is indicated for individuals or families who may carry this condition, as there are overlapping features with [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2004 |title=Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/fas_guidelines_accessible.pdf }}</ref>\\n\\n==Treatment==\\nSimilar to all genetic diseases Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome cannot be cured, although numerous treatments exist to increase the quality of life.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dovemed.com/article/aarskog-syndrome-aas/ |title=Aarskog Syndrome (AAS) |work=DoveMed |year=2014 |accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Surgery]] may be required to correct some of the anomalies, and [[orthodontic]] treatment may be used to correct some of the facial abnormalities.

The sons of female carriers are at 50% risk of being affected with the syndrome. The daughters of female carriers are at 50% risk of being carriers themselves. Females may have mild manifestations of the syndrome. The syndrome is caused by [[mutation]] in a [[gene]] called [[FGDY1]] in band p11.21 on the [[X chromosome]].\\n\\n==Pathophysiology==\\nThe Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is due to mutation in the [[FGD1]] gene. FGD1 encodes a [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] (GEF) that specifically activates [[Cdc42]], a member of the [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] (Ras homology) family of the p21 [[GTPase]]s. By activating Cdc42, FGD1 [[protein]] stimulates [[fibroblast]]s to form filopodia, cytoskeletal elements involved in cellular signaling, adhesion, and migration. Through Cdc42, FGD1 protein also activates the [[c-Jun N-terminal kinase]] (JNK) signaling cascade, a pathway that regulates cell growth, [[apoptosis]], and cellular differentiation.\\n\\nWithin the developing mouse skeleton, FGD1 protein is expressed in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations, the [[perichondrium]] and periosteum, proliferating [[chondrocyte]]s, and [[osteoblast]]s. These results suggest that FGD1 signaling may play a role in the biology of several different skeletal cell types including mesenchymal prechondrocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome.\\n\\nIt appears likely that the primary defect in Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is an abnormality of FGD1/Cdc42 signaling resulting in anomalous [[embryonic development]] and abnormal endochondral and intramembranous bone formation.\\n\\n==Diagnosis==\\n[[Genetic testing]] may be available for mutations in the FGDY1 gene.  [[Genetic counseling]] is indicated for individuals or families who may carry this condition, as there are overlapping features with [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2004 |title=Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/fas_guidelines_accessible.pdf }}</ref>\\n\\n==Treatment==\\nSimilar to all genetic diseases Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome cannot be cured, although numerous treatments exist to increase the quality of life.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dovemed.com/article/aarskog-syndrome-aas/ |title=Aarskog Syndrome (AAS) |work=DoveMed |year=2014 |accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Surgery]] may be required to correct some of the anomalies, and [[orthodontic]] treatment may be used to correct some of the facial abnormalities.

It was first described in the medical literature in 1987 by Ritscher and Schinzel, for whom the disorder is sometimes named.\\n\\n==Signs and symptoms==\\nThe classical triad of symptoms that defines 3C syndrome includes certain heart defects, [[hypoplasia]] (underdevelopment) of the [[cerebellum]], and cranial dysmorphisms, which can take various forms. The heart defects and cranial dysmorphisms are heterogeneous in individuals who are all classed as having Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome.<ref name=\"Orpha\"/>\\n\\nHeart defects commonly seen with Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome are associated with the [[endocardial cushion]] and are the most important factor in determining a diagnosis. The [[mitral valve]] and [[tricuspid valve]] of the heart can be malformed, the [[atrioventricular canal]] can be complete instead of developing into the [[interatrial septum]] and [[interventricular septum]], and [[conotruncal heart defect]]s, which include [[tetralogy of Fallot]], [[double outlet right ventricle]], [[transposition of the great vessels]],<ref name=\"Orpha\"/> and [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]]. [[Aortic stenosis]] and [[pulmonary stenosis]] have also been associated with 3C syndrome.<ref name=OMIM-C/>\\n\\nThe cranial dysmorphisms associated with 3C syndrome are heterogeneous and include a degree of [[macrocephaly]], a large [[anterior fontanel]], a particularly prominent [[occiput]] and forehead, ocular [[hypertelorism]] (wide-set eyes), slanted [[palpebral fissure]]s, [[cleft palate]], a depressed nasal bridge, [[cleft palate]] with associated [[palatine uvula#Variation|bifid uvula]],<ref name=\"Orpha\"/> low-set ears, [[micrognathia]] (an abnormally small jaw),<ref name=OMIM/> [[brachycephaly]] (flattened head), and ocular [[coloboma]].<ref name=OMIM-C>{{cite web |url = http://omim.org/clinicalSynopsis/220210 |title = Ritscher-Schinzel Syndrome - Clinical Synopsis |work = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |publisher = Johns Hopkins University |last1 = Kniffin |first1 = Cassandra L. |last2 = Jackson |first2 = John F. |date = 6 January 2014 |accessdate = 12 April 2014}}</ref> Low-set ears are the most common cranial dysmorphism seen in 3C syndrome, and ocular coloboma is the least common of the non-concurrent symptoms (cleft lip co-occurring with cleft palate is the least common).<ref name=Leonardi/>\\n\\nCranial dysplasias associated with 3C syndrome are also reflected in the brain. Besides the cerebellar hypoplasia, cysts are commonly found in the [[posterior cranial fossa]], the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] and the [[cisterna magna]] are dilated/enlarged, and [[Dandy-Walker malformation]] is present.

Joubert syndrome often manifests with similar cerebellar hypoplasia and its sequelae, including [[hyperpnea]], [[ataxia]], changes in eye movement, and cleft lip and palate. Occasionally, Joubert syndrome will include heart malformations. [[Brachmann-de Lange syndrome]] must also be differentiated from 3C syndrome. It presents with similar craniofacial and heart abnormalities and can include Dandy-Walker phenotype, making it difficult to distinguish. Dandy-Walker malformation is also occasionally seen in [[Ellis-van Creveld syndrome]], which is characterized by heart defects and malformed [[alveolar ridge]].<ref name=Leonardi/> Many disorders include the Dandy-Walker phenotype and thus it is not [[pathognomonic]] for 3C syndrome.<ref name=Albright>{{cite book |title = Principles and Practice of Pediatric Neurosurgery |publisher = Thieme |year = 2011 |first1 = A.

This condition occurs only in females, as there are no Y chromosomes present. Tetrasomy X was first described in 1961, and since then approximately 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Approximately 60 females have been described in medical literature with this condition.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}\\n\\n==Causes and diagnosis==\\n[[File:XXXX syndrome.svg|thumb|right]]Tetrasomy X is a [[aneuploidy|chromosomal aneuploidy]], meaning it arises from a defect in [[meiosis]]. This can occur when homologous X chromosomes fail to separate in the formation of the egg or sperm. Tetrasomy X is usually suspected based on symptoms present in the individual and is confirmed via [[karyotype|karyotyping]], which reveals the extra X chromosomes.\\n\\n==Symptoms==\\nSymptoms of tetrasomy X are highly variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Symptoms are often similar to those of [[trisomy X]].<ref name=Tartaglia>{{cite journal |title = A review of trisomy X (47, XXX) |first1 = Nicole R. |last = Tartaglia |first2 = Susan |last2 = Howell |first3 = Ashley |last3 = Sutherland |first4 = Rebecca |last4 = Wilson |first5 = Lennie |last5 = Wilson |journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |date = 11 May 2010 |volume = 5 |issue = 8 |doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-5-8 |PMC=2883963 |pmid=20459843}}</ref> Physically, tetrasomy X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as [[epicanthal fold]]s, flat nasal bridges, upslanting [[palpebral fissure]]s, midface [[hypoplasia]], small mouths, [[cleft palate|cleft or high arched palates]], delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including [[hypotonia]] and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study conducted by [http://www.genealogysource.com/tetra_x/ Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support] found that 10% of girls had joint laxity in the hips and 20% had joint limitations in a sample size of 20 tetrasomy and pentasomy patients.\\n\\nDevelopmentally, tetrasomy X patients frequently show mild delays in the areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo [[puberty]] normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical literature reports four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with [[trisomy 21]], one stillborn with [[omphalocele]].\\n\\nIn terms of internal organ systems, tetrasomy X patients may have abnormal vision, hearing, circulatory systems, kidneys, or nervous systems. Disorders of the eye include [[myopia]], [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[coloboma]], microphthalmus, or [[optic nerve hypoplasia]]. In terms of hearing, patients are more prone to [[ear infection]]s, sound blockage, or nerve abnormalities. Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including [[septal defect|ventricular/atrial septal defects]], [[atresia]], [[hypoplastic right heart syndrome]], [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and conotruncal or valvular cardiac defects. Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an [[EEG]] or [[MRI]].\\n\\n==Treatment and prognosis==\\nThe general prognosis for girls with tetrasomy X is relatively good. Due to the variability of symptoms, some tetrasomy X girls are able to function normally, whereas others will need medical attention throughout their lives. Traditionally, treatment for tetrasomy X has been management of the symptoms and support for learning.

It has been found to be caused by mutation in the [[endothelin B receptor gene]] (EDNRB).\\n\\n==Classification==\\n\\nABCD syndrome is defined as albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut, and [[deafness]].  It was initially misdiagnosed and later discovered that a [[homozygous]] [[mutation]] in the EDNRB gene causes ABCD syndrome. This helped scientists discover that it is the same as type IV Waardenburg syndrome, also known as Shah-[[Waardenburg Syndrome]].\\n\\n==Characteristics==\\n\\nIn the beginning, medical officials defined ABCD syndrome by the four key characteristics of the syndrome.  In the first case study of the Kurdish girl, researches described her as having \\u201calbinism and a black lock at the right temporo-occiptital region along [[Blaschko]] lines, her eyelashes and brows were white, the irises in her eyes appeared to be blue, she had spots of retinal [[depigmentation]], and she did not react to noise.\\u201d<ref name=\"gross\" />  The albinism is interesting in this diagnosis because the skin of an affected individual is albino pale besides the brown patches of mispigmented skin.  The \\u201cblack locks\\u201d described and seen in clinical pictures of the infants are thick patches of black hair above the ears that form a half circle reaching to the other ear to make a crest shape.\\n\\nAs identified in this first case study and stated in a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, ABCD syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201csnow white hair in patches, distinct black locks of hair, skin white except brown macules, deafness, irises gray to blue, nystagmus, [[photophobia]], poor visual activity, normal [[melanocytes]] in pigmented hair and skin, and absent melanocytes in areas of leukoderma.\\u201d<ref name=\"mallory\">{{cite encyclopedia| author = Mallory, Susan B.| title = ABCD Syndrome | encyclopedia = An Illustrated Dictionary of Dermatologic Syndromes | edition = 2  | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]]| year = 2006 }}</ref> Individuals have the blue/gray irises typical of people affected by blindness. The C of ABCD syndrome is what distinguishes this genetic disorder from BADS and it involves cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut.  This characteristic occurs when nerve cells do not function correctly in the gut, which results in aganglionosis: The intestines\\u2019 failure to move food along the digestive tract.  Deafness or being unresponsive to noise due to very low quality of hearing was reported in every case of ABCD syndrome.  The characteristics of ABCD syndrome are clearly evident in an inflicted individual.\\n\\nNo longer considered a separate syndrome, ABCD syndrome is today considered to be a variation of Shah-Waardenburg type IV. [[Waardenburg syndrome]] (WS) is described as \\u201cthe combination of sensorinerual hearing loss, hypopigmentation of skin and hair, and pigmentary disturbances of the irides.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\" /> Hearing loss and deafness, skin mispigmentation and albinism, and pigmentary changes in irises are the similarities between WS and ABCD. According to a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201cdepigmentaion of hair and skin - white forelock and prematuring graying of hair, confluent thick eyebrows, heterochromic irides or hypopigmentation of iris, laterally displacy inner canthi, congenital sensorinerual deafness, broad nasal root, autosomal dominant disorder, and other associated findings, including black forelocks.\\u201d<ref name=\"mallory\" />\\n\\n==Causes and DNA testing==\\n\\nResearchers in the past 20 years have determined that a gene mutation, specifically a [[homozygous]] mutation in the EDNRB gene, is the cause of ABCD syndrome. The advancement of technology led to new [[DNA]] material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely.  A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes.  The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called denaturing gradient [[gel electrophoresis]]. The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine align on the double strands of DNA. The test results found \\u201can aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene. The mutation was determined to be a homozygous C to T base pair transition at the amino acid level, causing a premature stop in gene translation.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\" /> This specialized testing enables geneticists to recognize the gene mutation that is the cause of ABCD syndrome.\\n\\nNew findings introduced an important break in the beliefs about ABCD syndrome because the endotherlin B gene is a gene involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.

Discovering that the same gene is involved in ABCD and Waardenburg syndrome is important because researchers can now look further into ways to fix this crucial gene.\\n\\n==Screening==\\n\\nScreening generally only takes place among those displaying several of the symptoms of ABCD, but a study on a large group of institutionalized deaf people in Columbia revealed that 5.38% of them were Waardenburg patients. Because of its rarity, none of the patients were diagnosed with ABCD (Waardenburg Type IV). Nothing can be done to prevent the disease.\\n\\n==Diagnosis==\\n\\nThe occurrence of WS has been reported to be one in 45,000 in Europe.

If the diagnosis is not made early enough, complications can arise from \\n[[Hirschsprung\\'s disease]].\\n\\n==Treatment==\\n\\nTreatment for the disease itself is nonexistent, but there are options for most of the symptoms. For example, one suffering from hearing loss would be given hearing aids, and those with Hirschsprung\\u2019s disorder can be treated with a colostomy.\\n\\n==Prognosis==\\n\\nIf the [[Hirschsprung\\'s disease]] is treated in time, ABCD sufferers live otherwise healthy lives.  If it is not found soon enough, death often occurs in infancy. For those suffering hearing loss, it is generally regressive and the damage to hearing increases over time. Digestive problems from the colostomy and reattachment may exist, but most cases can be treated with laxatives. The only other debilitating symptom is hearing loss, which is usually degenerative and can only be treated with surgery or hearing aids.\\n\\n==History==\\n\\nDutch ophthalmologist [[Petrus Johannes Waardenburg]] (1886\\u20131979) brought about the idea of Waardenburg syndrome when he examined two deaf twins.<ref name=\"p.j.waardenburg\">{{cite journal |first=P.

This helped them distinguish forms of Waardenburg syndrome.  Their evaluation consisted of specifying Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1), type II (WS2), type III (WS3), and type IV (WS4).\\n\\nIn 1995, a case study was performed of a Kurdish family.  Scientists completed a molecular analysis with DNA strands of the patients diagnosed with ABCD syndrome.  Their task was to scan the sequences to find a mutation in the EDNRB gene, one of the most important protein-coding genes.  When they completed the scan they \\u201cfound a homozygous C to T transition resulting, at the amino acid level, in a premature stop codon.\\u201d<ref name=\"verheij\">{{Cite journal |author= Verheij, Joke B.G.M., Jurgen Kunze, Jan Osinga, Anthonie J. van Essen, and Robert M.

Most notably the patient, per formal IQ testing, was not found to have frank mental retardation as has been previously reported among patients with chromosome 3q29 terminal deletion, but rather the patient has demonstrated an average full-scale IQ result.

       "[u\"'''13q deletion syndrome''' is a rare genetic disease caused by the deletion of some or all of the large arm of human chromosome 13. It causes intellectual disability and congenital malformations that affect a variety of organ systems.    Signs and symptoms   Different areas of deletion are associated with different symptoms. Deletions from the centromere to 13q32 or any deletions including the 13q32 band are associated with slow growth, intellectual disability, and congenital malformations. Deletions from 13q33 to the end of the chromosome are associated with intellectual disability. Intellectual disabilities range from very mild to very severe, and can co-occur with behavioral disorders and/or autism spectrum disorders.  At birth, the main symptoms include low weight (due to intrauterine growth restriction), hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. Infants may also have cleft palate.  13q deletion syndrome gives a characteristic appearance to affected individuals, potentially including microphthalmia (small eyes), hypertelorism (wide-set eyes), thin forehead, high palate, underdeveloped midface, small mouth, small nose, broad, flat nasal bridge, short neck, low hairline, irregular or wrongly positioned teeth, low-set ears, micrognathia (small jaw), tooth enamel defects, short stature, microcephaly (small head), a prominent, long philtrum, and earlobes turned inwards.  Congenital heart disease is associated with 13q deletion syndrome. Common defects include atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. Defects of the endocrine system, digestive system, and genitourinary system are also common. These include underdevelopment or agenesis of the pancreas, adrenal glands, thymus, gallbladder, and thyroid; Hirschsprung's disease; gastric reflux, imperforate anus, retention testis, ectopic kidney, renal agenesis, and hydronephrosis.  A variety of brain abnormalities are also associated with 13q deletion. They can include epilepsy, craniosynostosis (premature closing of the skull bones), spastic diplegia, cerebral hypotrophy, underdevelopment or agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia, deafness, and, rarely, hydrocephalus, Dandy\\u2013Walker syndrome, and spina bifida. The eyes can be severely damaged and affected individuals may be blind. They may also have coloboma of the iris or choroid, strabismus, nystagmus, glaucoma, or cataracts.  Other skeletal malformations are found with 13q deletion syndrome, including syndactyly, clubfoot, clinodactyly, and malformations of the vertebrae and/or thumbs.  Deletions that include the 13q32 band, which contains the brain development gene ZIC2,  are associated with holoprosencephaly; they are also associated with hand and foot malformations. Deletions that include the 13q14 band, which contains the tumor suppressor gene Rb, are associated with a higher risk of developing retinoblastoma, which is more common in XY children. Deletion of the 13q33.3 band is associated with hypospadias. Other genes in the potentially affected region include NUFIP1, HTR2A, PDCH8, and PCDH17.    Diagnosis   13q deletion syndrome can only be definitively diagnosed by genetic analysis, which can be done prenatally or after birth. Increased nuchal translucency in a first-trimester ultrasound may indicate the presence of 13q deletion.    Pathophysiology   This disorder is caused by the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13, which can either be deleted linearly or as a ring chromosome. It is typically not hereditary\\u2014the loss of a portion of the chromosome typically occurs during gametogenesis, making it a de novo mutation. When it is hereditary, it is usually caused by a parent having mosaicism or a balanced translocation.  The severity of the disorder is correlated with the size of the deletion, with larger deletions causing more severe manifestations.    Treatment   Although there is no cure for 13q deletion syndrome, symptoms can be managed, usually with the involvement of a neurologist, rehabilitation physician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, psychotherapist, nutritionist, special education professional, and/or speech therapist. If the affected child's growth is particularly slow, growth hormone treatment can be used to augment growth. Plastic surgeries can repair cleft palates, and surgical repair or monitoring by a pediatric cardiologist can manage cardiac defects. Some skeletal, neurological, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and ophthalmic abnormalities can be definitively treated with surgery. Endocrine abnormalities can often be managed medically. Special educators, speech and occupational therapists, and physiotherapists can help a child develop skills in and out of school.    Prognosis   Affected individuals have a somewhat shortened lifespan. The maximum described lifespan is 67 years. Adults with 13q deletion syndrome often need support services to maintain their activities of daily living, including adult day care services or housing services.    Epidemiology   It is incredibly rare, with fewer than 190 cases described.    History   13q deletion syndrome was first described in 1963 and fully characterized in 1971.       \",\n",
       " u' \\'\\'\\'Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome\\'\\'\\' is a rare disease inherited as autosomal dominant or X-linked and characterized by short stature, facial abnormalities, skeletal and genital anomalies.  The Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome (AAS) is also known as the \\'\\'\\'Aarskog syndrome\\'\\'\\',  \\'\\'\\'faciodigitogenital syndrome\\'\\'\\', \\'\\'\\'shawl scrotum syndrome\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'faciogenital dysplasia\\'\\'\\'.   Signs and symptoms  The Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is a disorder with short stature, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, anteverted nostrils, joint laxity, shawl scrotum, and mental retardation. The physical phenotype varies with age and postpuberal males may have only minor remnant manifestations of the prepuberal phenotype.  *Growth ** mild to moderate short stature evident by 1\\u20133 years of age ** delayed adolescent growth spurt *Performance ** slight (dull normal) to moderate mental deficiency ** hyperactivity and attention deficit ** social performance usually good *Face ** rounded face ** widow\\'s peak hairline ** wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) ** droopy eyelids (blepharoptosis) ** downslanting eye slits (palpebral fissures) ** small nose with nostrils tipped forward (anteverted) ** underdeveloped mid-portion of the face (maxilla) ** wide groove above the upper lip (broad philtrum) ** crease below the lower lip ** delayed eruption of teeth ** top portion (upper helix) of the ear folded over slightly *Hands and feet ** small, broad hands and feet ** short fingers and toes (brachydactyly) ** in-curving of the 5th finger (clinodactyly) ** mild interdigital webbing, between fingers as well as toes ** single transverse \"simian crease\" in palm ** broad thumbs and big toes *Neck ** short neck ** webbing of sides of the neck *Chest ** mild pectus excavatum (sunken chest) *Abdomen ** protruding navel ** inguinal hernias *Genitalia ** shawl scrotum ** undescended testicles    Genetics   X-linked recessive inheritance. Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is transmitted in an X-linked recessive manner. The sons of female carriers are at 50% risk of being affected with the syndrome. The daughters of female carriers are at 50% risk of being carriers themselves. Females may have mild manifestations of the syndrome. The syndrome is caused by mutation in a gene called FGDY1 in band p11.21 on the X chromosome.   Pathophysiology  The Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is due to mutation in the FGD1 gene. FGD1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates Cdc42, a member of the Rho (Ras homology) family of the p21 GTPases. By activating Cdc42, FGD1 protein stimulates fibroblasts to form filopodia, cytoskeletal elements involved in cellular signaling, adhesion, and migration. Through Cdc42, FGD1 protein also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade, a pathway that regulates cell growth, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation.  Within the developing mouse skeleton, FGD1 protein is expressed in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations, the perichondrium and periosteum, proliferating chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. These results suggest that FGD1 signaling may play a role in the biology of several different skeletal cell types including mesenchymal prechondrocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome.  It appears likely that the primary defect in Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome is an abnormality of FGD1/Cdc42 signaling resulting in anomalous embryonic development and abnormal endochondral and intramembranous bone formation.   Diagnosis  Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the FGDY1 gene.  Genetic counseling is indicated for individuals or families who may carry this condition, as there are overlapping features with fetal alcohol syndrome.   Treatment  Similar to all genetic diseases Aarskog\\u2013Scott syndrome cannot be cured, although numerous treatments exist to increase the quality of life.  Surgery may be required to correct some of the anomalies, and orthodontic treatment may be used to correct some of the facial abnormalities. Trials of growth hormone have been effective to treat short stature in this disorder.   Prognosis  Mild degrees of mental slowness may be present, but affected children usually have good social skills. Some males may exhibit reduced fertility.  Some recent findings have included cystic changes in the brain and generalized seizures  . There may be difficulty growing in the first year of life in up to one-third of cases. Misaligned teeth may require orthodontic correction. An undescended testicle will require surgery.  Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (MIM 103050, ADSL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease causing severe mental retardation and/or autistic features.1,2 Seizures are often observed (80%),3 varying in age of onset (from newborn to late childhood) and nature (tonic-clonic, \\u201csuppression burst\\u201d pattern, West syndrome, etc.), and are very often resistant to all medication. Around 50% of the children show autistic-like behaviour.4 Microcephaly is rare (1/13 of reported cases). Non-specific anomalies of the brain, such as hypoplasia of the vermis, cerebral atrophy,5 lack of myelination,6 white matter anomalies,7 and lissencephaly4 have often been described.  \\'\\'\\'Other Complications\\'\\'\\': \\u2022 Low self-esteem \\u2022 Social difficulties related to physical problems \\u2022 Male infertility in those with both testes undescended \\u2022 Problems with the structure of the heart \\u2022 Accumulation of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema, cystic hygroma) \\u2022 Failure to thrive in infants.   History  The syndrome is named for Dagfinn Aarskog, a Norwegian pediatrician and human geneticist who first described it in 1970, and for Charles I. Scott, Jr., an American medical geneticist who independently described the syndrome in 1971.

       " u\"  '''3C syndrome''', also known as '''CCC dysplasia''', '''Craniocerebellocardiac dysplasia''' or '''Ritscher\\u2013Schinzel syndrome''', is a rare condition, whose symptoms include heart defects, cerebellar hypoplasia, and cranial dysmorphism. It was first described in the medical literature in 1987 by Ritscher and Schinzel, for whom the disorder is sometimes named.   Signs and symptoms  The classical triad of symptoms that defines 3C syndrome includes certain heart defects, hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the cerebellum, and cranial dysmorphisms, which can take various forms. The heart defects and cranial dysmorphisms are heterogeneous in individuals who are all classed as having Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome.  Heart defects commonly seen with Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome are associated with the endocardial cushion and are the most important factor in determining a diagnosis. The mitral valve and tricuspid valve of the heart can be malformed, the atrioventricular canal can be complete instead of developing into the interatrial septum and interventricular septum, and conotruncal heart defects, which include tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great vessels, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis have also been associated with 3C syndrome.  The cranial dysmorphisms associated with 3C syndrome are heterogeneous and include a degree of macrocephaly, a large anterior fontanel, a particularly prominent occiput and forehead, ocular hypertelorism (wide-set eyes), slanted palpebral fissures, cleft palate, a depressed nasal bridge, cleft palate with associated bifid uvula, low-set ears, micrognathia (an abnormally small jaw), brachycephaly (flattened head), and ocular coloboma. Low-set ears are the most common cranial dysmorphism seen in 3C syndrome, and ocular coloboma is the least common of the non-concurrent symptoms (cleft lip co-occurring with cleft palate is the least common).  Cranial dysplasias associated with 3C syndrome are also reflected in the brain. Besides the cerebellar hypoplasia, cysts are commonly found in the posterior cranial fossa, the ventricles and the cisterna magna are dilated/enlarged, and Dandy-Walker malformation is present. These are reflected in the developmental delays typical of the disease. 75% of children with 3C syndrome have Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephalus.  Signs and symptoms in other body systems are also associated with 3C syndrome. In the skeletal system, ribs may be absent, and hemivertebrae, syndactyly (fusion of fingers together), and clinodactyly (curvature of the fifth finger) may be present. In the GI and genitourinary systems, anal atresia, hypospadia (misplaced urethra), and hydronephrosis may exist. Adrenal hypoplasia and growth hormone deficiency are associated endocrine consequences of Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. Some immunodeficiency has also been reported in connection with 3C syndrome.  Many children with the disorder die as infants due to severe congenital heart disease. The proband of Ritscher and Schinzel's original study was still alive at the age of 21.  A fetus with 3C syndrome may have an umbilical cord with one umbilical artery instead of two.   Differential diagnosis  There is an overlap in symptoms between 3C syndrome and Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome often manifests with similar cerebellar hypoplasia and its sequelae, including hyperpnea, ataxia, changes in eye movement, and cleft lip and palate. Occasionally, Joubert syndrome will include heart malformations. Brachmann-de Lange syndrome must also be differentiated from 3C syndrome. It presents with similar craniofacial and heart abnormalities and can include Dandy-Walker phenotype, making it difficult to distinguish. Dandy-Walker malformation is also occasionally seen in Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, which is characterized by heart defects and malformed alveolar ridge. Many disorders include the Dandy-Walker phenotype and thus it is not pathognomonic for 3C syndrome.   CHARGE syndrome can also be misdiagnosed. This is because both CHARGE syndrome and 3C syndrome share symptoms of ocular colobomas, cardiac defects, growth retardation, and minor facial abnormalities.  Coffin-Siris syndrome presents with fifth-finger deformities and congenital heart defects. It is distinguished from 3C syndrome by differences in facial dysmorphisms.   Prognosis  Prognoses for 3C syndrome vary widely based on the specific constellation of symptoms seen in an individual. Typically, the gravity of the prognosis correlates with the severity of the cardiac abnormalities. For children with less severe cardiac abnormalities, the developmental prognosis depends on the cerebellar abnormalities that are present. Severe cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with growth and speech delays, as well as hypotonia and general growth deficiencies.   Genetics   autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This means that two parents with one copy of the gene each will not have the disease themselves, but can pass on the gene to their children. Statistically, one in four of these children will inherit both copies of the recessive gene and develop the disease. 3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, caused by a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 8 at 8q24.13, the locus for KIAA0196, the gene for the protein strumpellin. Strumpellin is highly expressed in skeletal muscle cells and mutations in it are also associated with spastic paraplegia. Strumpellin is involved in endosomal transport and cell death processes. The mutation occurs at a splice site  and causes a substantial decrease in the amount of strumpellin produced by the cell. The phenotype is similar to 6pter-p24 deletion syndrome and 6p25 deletion syndrome but has a different etiology.   :The only way to test for this condition before birth is through ultrasound.  ::*First-trimester ultrasounds can detected nuchal abnormalities  ::*Second-trimester ultrasounds can pick up characteristic major structural abnormalities.  Because 3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, parents with one child with the disorder have a 25% chance of having another child with the disorder.   Management and treatment  The outcome of this disease is dependent on the severity of the cardiac defects. Approximately 1 in 3 children with this diagnosis require shunting for the hydrocephaly that is often a consequence. Some children require extra assistance or therapy for delayed psychomotor and speech development, including hypotonia.   Epidemiology  3C syndrome is very rare, occurring in less than 1 birth per million. Because of consanguinity due to a founder effect, it is much more common in a remote First Nations village in Manitoba, where 1 in 9 people carries the recessive gene.   History  The syndrome was first reported in 1987 in two sisters who had similar craniofacial abnormalities, Dandy-Walker phenotype, and congenital heart abnormalities. Neither of the parents was affected, indicating that the disorder was transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. The syndrome's symptoms were further refined in 1989 when the third case of the syndrome was reported, with similar craniofacial abnormalities to the first two cases, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the cisterna magna and fourth ventricle of the brain.   Other animals  Animal models of 3C syndrome have not been created; however, strumpellin is a highly conserved protein, with 12 known homologs and 83 known orthologs.   References      \",\n",
       " u\"   '''X\\u30021XXX syndrome''' (also called '''tetrasomy X''', '''quadruple X''', or '''48, XXXX''') \\u0627\\u0645\\u0645is a rare chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of four X chromosomes instead of two X chromosomes. This condition occurs only in females, as there are no Y chromosomes present. Tetrasomy X was first described in 1961, and since then approximately 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Approximately 60 females have been described in medical literature with this condition.   Causes and diagnosis  rightTetrasomy X is a chromosomal aneuploidy, meaning it arises from a defect in meiosis. This can occur when homologous X chromosomes fail to separate in the formation of the egg or sperm. Tetrasomy X is usually suspected based on symptoms present in the individual and is confirmed via karyotyping, which reveals the extra X chromosomes.   Symptoms  Symptoms of tetrasomy X are highly variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Symptoms are often similar to those of trisomy X. Physically, tetrasomy X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridges, upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small mouths, cleft or high arched palates, delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study conducted by  Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support found that 10% of girls had joint laxity in the hips and 20% had joint limitations in a sample size of 20 tetrasomy and pentasomy patients.  Developmentally, tetrasomy X patients frequently show mild delays in the areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo puberty normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical literature reports four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with trisomy 21, one stillborn with omphalocele.  In terms of internal organ systems, tetrasomy X patients may have abnormal vision, hearing, circulatory systems, kidneys, or nervous systems. Disorders of the eye include myopia, nystagmus, coloboma, microphthalmus, or optic nerve hypoplasia. In terms of hearing, patients are more prone to ear infections, sound blockage, or nerve abnormalities. Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including ventricular/atrial septal defects, atresia, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and conotruncal or valvular cardiac defects. Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an EEG or MRI.   Treatment and prognosis  The general prognosis for girls with tetrasomy X is relatively good. Due to the variability of symptoms, some tetrasomy X girls are able to function normally, whereas others will need medical attention throughout their lives. Traditionally, treatment for tetrasomy X has been management of the symptoms and support for learning. Most girls are placed on estrogen treatment to induce breast development, arrest longitudinal growth, and stimulate bone formation to prevent osteoporosis. Speech, occupational, and physical therapy may also be needed depending on the severity of the symptoms.    In other species   With the Echidna this kind of chromosomal arrangement is normal. In this species genetic sex differentiation works like this  * 63 (X1Y1X2Y2X3Y3X4Y4X5, male) and  * 64 (X1X1X2X2X3X3X4X4X5X5, female)   See also  * Triple X syndrome * XXXXX syndrome   References    *  *    External links  *  Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support     \",\n",
       " u'    \\'\\'\\'ABCD syndrome\\'\\'\\' is the acronym for albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut and sensorineural deafness. It has been found to be caused by mutation in the endothelin B receptor gene (EDNRB).   Classification   ABCD syndrome is defined as albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut, and deafness.  It was initially misdiagnosed and later discovered that a homozygous mutation in the EDNRB gene causes ABCD syndrome. This helped scientists discover that it is the same as type IV Waardenburg syndrome, also known as Shah-Waardenburg Syndrome.   Characteristics   In the beginning, medical officials defined ABCD syndrome by the four key characteristics of the syndrome.  In the first case study of the Kurdish girl, researches described her as having \\u201calbinism and a black lock at the right temporo-occiptital region along Blaschko lines, her eyelashes and brows were white, the irises in her eyes appeared to be blue, she had spots of retinal depigmentation, and she did not react to noise.\\u201d  The albinism is interesting in this diagnosis because the skin of an affected individual is albino pale besides the brown patches of mispigmented skin.  The \\u201cblack locks\\u201d described and seen in clinical pictures of the infants are thick patches of black hair above the ears that form a half circle reaching to the other ear to make a crest shape.  As identified in this first case study and stated in a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, ABCD syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201csnow white hair in patches, distinct black locks of hair, skin white except brown macules, deafness, irises gray to blue, nystagmus, photophobia, poor visual activity, normal melanocytes in pigmented hair and skin, and absent melanocytes in areas of leukoderma.\\u201d Individuals have the blue/gray irises typical of people affected by blindness. The C of ABCD syndrome is what distinguishes this genetic disorder from BADS and it involves cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut.  This characteristic occurs when nerve cells do not function correctly in the gut, which results in aganglionosis: The intestines\\u2019 failure to move food along the digestive tract.  Deafness or being unresponsive to noise due to very low quality of hearing was reported in every case of ABCD syndrome.  The characteristics of ABCD syndrome are clearly evident in an inflicted individual.  No longer considered a separate syndrome, ABCD syndrome is today considered to be a variation of Shah-Waardenburg type IV. Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is described as \\u201cthe combination of sensorinerual hearing loss, hypopigmentation of skin and hair, and pigmentary disturbances of the irides.\\u201d Hearing loss and deafness, skin mispigmentation and albinism, and pigmentary changes in irises are the similarities between WS and ABCD. According to a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome has many notable features, including \\u201cdepigmentaion of hair and skin - white forelock and prematuring graying of hair, confluent thick eyebrows, heterochromic irides or hypopigmentation of iris, laterally displacy inner canthi, congenital sensorinerual deafness, broad nasal root, autosomal dominant disorder, and other associated findings, including black forelocks.\\u201d   Causes and DNA testing   Researchers in the past 20 years have determined that a gene mutation, specifically a homozygous mutation in the EDNRB gene, is the cause of ABCD syndrome. The advancement of technology led to new DNA material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely.  A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes.  The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine align on the double strands of DNA. The test results found \\u201can aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene. The mutation was determined to be a homozygous C to T base pair transition at the amino acid level, causing a premature stop in gene translation.\\u201d This specialized testing enables geneticists to recognize the gene mutation that is the cause of ABCD syndrome.  New findings introduced an important break in the beliefs about ABCD syndrome because the endotherlin B gene is a gene involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. The endothelin receptor B produces Waardenburg syndrome type IV. Researchers began discussing the possibility that ABCD syndrome was in fact not a syndrome; rather it was a type of another syndrome known as Waardenburg.  Discovering that the same gene is involved in ABCD and Waardenburg syndrome is important because researchers can now look further into ways to fix this crucial gene.   Screening   Screening generally only takes place among those displaying several of the symptoms of ABCD, but a study on a large group of institutionalized deaf people in Columbia revealed that 5.38% of them were Waardenburg patients. Because of its rarity, none of the patients were diagnosed with ABCD (Waardenburg Type IV). Nothing can be done to prevent the disease.   Diagnosis   The occurrence of WS has been reported to be one in 45,000 in Europe.  The diagnosis can be made prenatally by ultrasound due to the phenotype displaying pigmentary disturbances, facial abnormalities, and other developmental defects. After birth, the diagnosis is initially made symptomatically and can be confirmed through genetic testing. If the diagnosis is not made early enough, complications can arise from  Hirschsprung\\'s disease.   Treatment   Treatment for the disease itself is nonexistent, but there are options for most of the symptoms. For example, one suffering from hearing loss would be given hearing aids, and those with Hirschsprung\\u2019s disorder can be treated with a colostomy.   Prognosis   If the Hirschsprung\\'s disease is treated in time, ABCD sufferers live otherwise healthy lives.  If it is not found soon enough, death often occurs in infancy. For those suffering hearing loss, it is generally regressive and the damage to hearing increases over time. Digestive problems from the colostomy and reattachment may exist, but most cases can be treated with laxatives. The only other debilitating symptom is hearing loss, which is usually degenerative and can only be treated with surgery or hearing aids.   History   Dutch ophthalmologist Petrus Johannes Waardenburg (1886\\u20131979) brought about the idea of Waardenburg syndrome when he examined two deaf twins. Waardenburg decided to define the syndrome with the six major symptoms that patients most commonly had.  * He defined \\u201clateral displacement of the medial canthi combined with dystopia of the lacrimal punctum and blepharophimosis\\u201d referring to people with broader and flatter nasal bridges, which in turn leads to folds in the skin that cover the inner corners of the eye. * Secondly, people who are born with a \\u201cprominent broad nasal root,\\u201d have a widened area between the eyes, causing them to have a flatter and wider face, along with eyes farther apart than normal.   * Thirdly, \\u201chypertrichosis of the medial part of the eyebrows\\u201d is present, meaning excessive hair growth in the patients\\u2019 eyebrow region, most likely leading to a unibrow.   * The fourth symptom, \"white forelock,\" was commonly seen as depigmented strands of hair * \\u201cHeterochromia iridis\\u201d indicates that the patient has two different colored eyes or two colors in the same eyes.  * \\u201cDeaf-mutism\\u201d: People with the disorder are both deaf and mute.  When scientists further investigated the syndrome, they realized that patients exhibited a wider range of symptoms of this disease in different combinations. This helped them distinguish forms of Waardenburg syndrome.  Their evaluation consisted of specifying Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1), type II (WS2), type III (WS3), and type IV (WS4).  In 1995, a case study was performed of a Kurdish family.  Scientists completed a molecular analysis with DNA strands of the patients diagnosed with ABCD syndrome.  Their task was to scan the sequences to find a mutation in the EDNRB gene, one of the most important protein-coding genes.  When they completed the scan they \\u201cfound a homozygous C to T transition resulting, at the amino acid level, in a premature stop codon.\\u201d Then, they went back and defined that Shah-Waardenburg syndrome consisted majorly of \\u201cmutations in the ENDRB or END3 gene,\\u201d along \\u201cwith some SOX10 mutations.\\u201d  Therefore, the researchers confirmed that ABCD syndrome was a form of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.  The genetic tests that they performed on the patients DNA helped in identifying the appropriate diagnosis.  In 2002, Whitkop and other scientists examined patients born with white hair, some black locks, and depigmented skin; he diagnosed them as having black lock albinism deafness syndrome (BADS).  Those who were closely working with this case suggested that it was an autoimmune disorder rather than a genetic defect.  However, soon after, they had a patient who was one of fourteen children of Kurdish parents.  The pedigree they examined revealed autosomal-recessive inheritance which led to cell migration of the neurocytes in the gut and, therefore, they redefined the syndrome as ABCD syndrome. This revealed \\u201ca homozygous nonsense mutation in the EDNRB gene\\u201d meaning that ABCD syndrome was not a separate entity but rather the same as Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.

       " u\"  '''XXXXX syndrome''' (also called '''pentasomy X''' or '''49,XXXXX''') is a type of aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) which results in the presence of three additional X chromosomes.  The condition was first described in 1963. It is characterized by severe intellectual disability, short stature and abnormalities to the head and face. As these features can be seen in other conditions, karyotyping must be carried out to confirm diagnosis.  There have been cases of XXXXX syndrome being misdiagnosed as Down syndrome.  It is an extremely rare condition with no more than 30 patients reported in medical literature. The exact incidence is not known but it may be similar to the rate of 1 in 85,000 seen in males with 49, XXXXY syndrome.   Signs and symptoms  The main characteristics of XXXXX syndrome are intellectual disability, short stature and craniofacial abnormalities. Other physical traits include the following:  * Small head * Ear abnormalities * Widely spaced eyes with upward slanting palpebral fissures and epicanthal folds  * Short neck * Broad nose with a depressed nasal bridge * Hyperextension of the elbows * Dental abnormalities and cleft palate * Clinodactyly of the 5th finger * Deformities of the feet * Heart defects   Causes   The aneuplody is thought to be caused by problems occurring during meiosis, either in the mother or in both the mother and father. Successive nondisjunctions have been observed in the mother of at least one patient. The features of the syndrome likely arise due to failure of x inactivation and the presence of multiple X chromosomes from the same parent causing problems with parental imprinting. In theory, X inactivation should occur and leave only one X chromosome active in each cell. However, failure of this process has been observed in one individual studied. The reason for this is thought to be the presence of an unusually large, and imbalanced, number of X chromosomes interfering with the process.

       " u' A \\'\\'\\'rare disease\\'\\'\\', also referred to as an \\'\\'\\'orphan disease\\'\\'\\', is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population.  Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person\\'s entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear.  Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday. With a single diagnosed patient only, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency is considered the rarest genetic disease.  No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare. A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.   Definition  There is no single, widely accepted definition for rare diseases.  Some definitions rely solely on the number of people living with a disease, and other definitions include other factors, such as the existence of adequate treatments or the severity of the disease.  In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines \\'\\'rare disease\\'\\' strictly according to prevalence, specifically \"any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States,\" or about 1 in 1,500 people.  This definition is essentially like that of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, a federal law that was written to encourage research into rare diseases and possible cures.  In Japan, the legal definition of a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan, or about 1 in 2,500 people.  However, the European Commission on Public Health defines rare diseases as \"life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases which are of such low prevalence that special combined efforts are needed to address them.\"  The term \\'\\'low prevalence\\'\\' is later defined as generally meaning fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.  Diseases that are statistically rare, but not also life-threatening, chronically debilitating, or inadequately treated, are excluded from their definition.  The definitions used in the medical literature and by national health plans are similarly divided, with definitions ranging from 1/1,000 to 1/200,000.   Relationship to orphan diseases  Because of definitions that include reference to treatment availability, a lack of resources, and severity of the disease, the term \\'\\'orphan disease\\'\\' is used as a synonym for \\'\\'rare disease\\'\\'.  But in the United States and the European Union, \"orphan diseases\" have a distinct legal meaning.  The orphan drug movement began in the United States.  The United States\\' Orphan Drug Act includes both rare diseases and any non-rare diseases \"for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug\" as \\'\\'orphan diseases\\'\\'.  The European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) also includes both rare diseases and neglected diseases into a larger category of \"orphan diseases\".   Prevalence  Prevalence (number of people living with a disease at a given moment), rather than incidence (number of new diagnoses in a given year), is used to describe the impact of rare diseases. The Global Genes Project estimates some 300 million people worldwide are affected by a rare disease.  The European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) estimates that as many as 5,000 to 7,000 distinct rare diseases exist, and as much as 6% to 8% of the population of the European Union is affected by one. Only about 400 rare diseases have therapies and about 80% have a genetic component according to Rare Genomics Institute.  Rare diseases can vary in prevalence between populations, so a disease that is rare in some populations may be common in others.  This is especially true of genetic diseases and infectious diseases.  An example is cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease:  it is rare in most parts of Asia but relatively common in Europe and in populations of European descent.  In smaller communities, the founder effect can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community.  Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else.  Other diseases, such as many rare forms of cancer, have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare.  The classification of other conditions depends in part on the population being studied:  All forms of cancer in children are generally considered rare, because so few children develop cancer, but the same cancer in adults may be more common.  About 40 rare diseases have a far higher prevalence in Finland;  these are known collectively as Finnish heritage disease.   Characteristics   Rare diseases are usually genetic and are therefore chronic. EURORDIS estimates that at least 80% of them have identified genetic origins. Other rare diseases are the result of infections and allergies or due to degenerative and proliferative causes.  Symptoms of some rare diseases may appear at birth or in childhood, whereas others only appear once adulthood is reached.  Research publications emphasize rare diseases that are chronic or incurable, although many short-term medical conditions are also rare diseases.   Public research  The NIH\\'s Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) was established by H.R. 4013/Public Law 107-280 in 2002. H.R. 4014, signed the same day, refers to the \"Rare Diseases Orphan Product Development Act\". Similar initiatives have been proposed in Europe.   Public awareness   The first Rare Disease Day was held in Europe and Canada in February 2008 to raise awareness for rare diseases.  It is intended to be observed on the last day of February every year.   Support    The National Organization for Rare Disorders was established in 1983 by individuals and families with rare diseases.  Genetic Alliance, established in 1986, lists information and support groups for approximately 1200 rare diseases.  The Global Genes Project is one of the leading rare and genetic disease patient advocacy organizations in the world. The non-profit organization is led by Team R.A.R.E. (R.A.R.E stands for Rare disease, Advocacy, Research and Education). Global Genes promotes the needs of the rare and genetic disease community under a unifying symbol of hope \\u2013 the Blue Denim Genes Ribbon\\u2122. What began as a grassroots movement in 2009 with a few rare disease parent advocates and foundations has grown to over 500 global organizations. Global Genes uses a simple concept of \"genes and jeans\" to broadly promote the needs of the rare and genetic disease community. The organization has launched a number of innovative rare and genetic disease awareness campaigns including, Hope, It\\'s In Our Genes\\u2122, Wear That You Care\\u2122, 7,000 Bracelets for Hope\\u2122 to represent the 7,000 different rare diseases and Unite 1 Million For RARE\\u2122 disease.  The Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (CORD) is the national network of organizations who represent people affected by rare disorders within Canada. CORD\\'s intention is to provide a strong common voice advocating for a healthcare system and health policy for those with rare disorders.  Patients with rare diseases in Greece are represented by the Greek Alliance of Rare Diseases.

       " u\" '''2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria''' is a group of rare neurometabolic disorders characterized by the significantly elevated levels of hydroxyglutaric acid in ones urine. It is either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant.   Classification  Most forms of 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.  2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an organic aciduria, and because of the stereoisomeric property of 2-hydroxyglutarate different variants of this disorder are distinguished:   =L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria =  The L-2 form is more common, severe, and mainly affects the central nervous system. The basal ganglia are affected, and cystic cavitations in the white matter of the brain are common, beginning in infancy. This form is chronic, with early symptoms such as hypotonia, tremors, and epilepsy declining into spongiform leukoencephalopathy, muscular choreodystonia, mental retardation, and psychomotor regression.  It is associated with ''L2HGDH''.   =D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria =  The D2 form is rare, with symptoms including macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness.  It is caused by recessive mutations in ''D2HGDH'' (type I) or by dominant gain-of-function mutations in ''IDH2'' (type II).   =Combined D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria =  The combined form is characterized by severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and absence of developmental progress. It is caused by recessive mutations in ''SLC25A1'' encoding the mitochondrial citrate carrier.

       " u\"  '''8p23.1 duplication syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder caused by a duplication of a region from human chromosome 8. This duplication syndrome has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 64,000 births  and is the reciprocal of the 8p23.1 deletion syndrome. The 8p23.1 duplication is associated with a variable phenotype including one or more of speech delay, developmental delay, mild dysmorphism, with prominent forehead and arched eyebrows, and congenital heart disease (CHD).   Syndrome description   The phenotypic data on 11 patients indicated that cases are not always ascertained for CHD but that CHD was the most common single feature found in 6 out of 11 individuals. Developmental delay and/or learning difficulties were found in 5 out of 11 cases, but one prenatal case was developing normally at 15 months of age (Case 1,). Three other prenatal cases could not yet be reliably assessed. A variable degree of facial dysmorphism was present in 5 out of 11 individuals. Partial toe syndactyly has been found in one mother and son diad and adrenal anomalies in two probands but not in the duplicated mother of one of them. The phenotype is compatible with independent adult life with varying degrees of support. Duplication of the GATA4 transcription factor () is believed to underlie the congenital heart disease and other genes, common to the duplication and deletion syndromes, can be regarded as candidates for the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome. These include the SOX7 transcription factor () for both CHD  and developmental delay  and the TNKS gene () for behavioural difficulties. The diaphragmatic hernia found in the 8p23.1 deletion syndrome has not been found in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome to date. The duplication may be associated with copy number changes of the adjacent olfactory receptor/defensin repeats (ORDRs) that predispose to the 8p23.1 deletion and duplication syndromes. High total copy numbers of these repeats have been associated with predisposition to psoriasis and low copy number with predisposition to Crohn's disease.    Size of duplication    The duplication includes ~3.75 Mb between the distal and proximal ORDRs at either end of band 8p23.1. The copy number of the adjacent repeats may also be altered. The 8p23.1 duplication syndrome cannot be distinguished using conventional cytogenetics from high level copy number variation of the repeats themselves.  Both de novo cases and families with transmitted duplications from parents of both sex are known. The duplication is believed to arise de novo as a result of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between the proximal and distal ORDRs. NAHR is also thought to give rise to the reciprocal microdeletion syndrome, the polymorphic inversion between the ORDRs and a variety of other large scale abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 8.

       " u\"  '''3q29 microdeletion syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder resulting from the deletion of a segment of chromosome 3.  This syndrome was first described in 2005.    Clinical description    The clinical phenotype of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome is variable. Clinical features can include mild/moderate mental retardation with mildly dysmorphic facial features (long and narrow face, short philtrum and a high nasal bridge). Of the 6 reported patients, additional features including autism, ataxia, chest-wall deformity and long, tapering fingers were found in at least two patients.  A review of 14 children with insterstitial deletions of 3q29, found 11 who had the common recurrent 1.6Mb deletion and displayed mental retardation and microcephaly.   The variability of phenotype is underscored by the report on a 6 and 9/12 year-old male patient with a de novo chromosome 3q29 microdeletion identified by BAC array comparative genomic hybridization assay (aCGH), with accompanying normal 46,XY high-resolution chromosome analysis.  The patient has language-based learning disabilities and behavioral features consistent with diagnoses of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of the inattentive type.  He also displays some other features previously associated with chromosome 3q29 microdeletion such as an elongated face, long fingers, and joint laxity.  Most notably the patient, per formal IQ testing, was not found to have frank mental retardation as has been previously reported among patients with chromosome 3q29 terminal deletion, but rather the patient has demonstrated an average full-scale IQ result.  This report further expands the phenotypic spectrum to include the possibility of normal intelligence as corroborated by formal, longitudinal psycho-educational testing.  The presence of two homologous low copy repeats either side of the deletion break-point suggests that nonallelic homologous recombination is the likely mechanism underlying this syndrome.   Research  Research on the risk for developing schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jewish and other populations showed that 3q29 microdeletion syndrome leads to a significant higher rate of schizophrenia.    Affected genes    The microdeletion, around 1.6 million base pairs, in length and encompasses 5 known genes and 17 uncharacterised transcripts. These include transferrin receptor, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase A, RNF168, serine/threonine-protein kinase, nuclear cap-binding protein complex, melanotransferrin, DLG1 and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase    External links   *           \"]"
